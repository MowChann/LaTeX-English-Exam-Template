\ReadingSection{A}

One night four college students were out late and didn't study for the test which was the next day. In the morning, they thought of a plan. They made themselves look dirty. Then they went to the dean \hint{教务长} and said they had gone out to a party last night and that on their way back the tire \hint{车胎} of their car burst and they had to push the car all the way back. So they were in no condition to take the test.

The dean thought for a minute and said they could have the test again after three days. They thanked him and said they would be ready by that time.

On the fourth day, they appeared before the dean. The dean said that this was a “Special Condition Test”, all four were required to sit in separate classrooms for the test. They all agreed as they had prepared well in the last three days.

The test only had two questions with the total of 100 points.

(1) \textit{Your Name} \blank (1 \textit{Points})

(2) \textit{Which tire burst?} \blank (99 \textit{Points})

When is your best study time? Do you feel most like studying in the hours of the night? If so, you are not alone. But \emph{that}  can be a problem for parents and schools.

While some students like to get up early in the morning and study, most will say that late-night studying is most productive \hint{有效的}. When it comes to brain power, students will say they perform better at night, and the fact that parents might find surprising and interesting is that science seems to agree.

This can be a problem. School starts early in the morning for most students, but science also shows that the amount of sleep you get will affect your performance.

Here Are a Few Tips for Late-Night Studying:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Find out if you are a morning person or a night person. You might surprise yourself. Try getting up early to study and see if it works out.
  \item Have a talk with parents to tell them that teen brains do perform better at night. Show them the science. You might be able to come up with a solution.
  \item Insist on a good “start time” for studying if you need to study late. Remember don't turn on the TV after dinner!
  \item Insist on a proper time for closing books and getting to sleep.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}[resume,ref={\arabic*},labelsep=-0.1em]

\item[\choice{C}] The word “\emph{that}” in the first paragraph refers to \blank.
\options
  {morning studying}
  {studying time}
  {night studying}
  {studying hours}

\item[\choice{B}] It seems that science shows that \blank.
\options
  {the morning time is the best time to study}
  {the night time is the best time to study}
  {getting up early is good for studying}
  {staying up late is bad for studying}

\item[\choice{A}] From the passage we know \blank.
\options
  {you won’t perform well if you can’t get enough sleep}
  {we shouldn’t stay up too late to study for a test}
  {the more time you spend on study, the better grades you will get}
  {it is good to stay up late to study before an exam}

\item[\choice{A}] What does the passage mainly tell us?
\options
  {Whether you should stay up late to study.}
  {You should get enough sleep.}
  {How to find a good time to study.}
  {Don’t stay up late to study.}
 
\end{enumerate}


\ReadingSection{C}

People do not often think about the women's national team when it comes to Chinese football. That was until the ladies completed an amazing second-half comeback in the final of the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup on February 6.

The ladies were playing against South Korea. The halftime score (2-0) came as a big disappointment. However, the Chinese ladies on the field didn't lose heart. Instead, they fought back. In the second half of the match, three ladies each scored a goal and beat South Korea 3-2.

Their final win sent the team to the headlines of almost every newspaper in China. But it's hard to say how long this spotlight  \hint{聚光AT}  will last. Will people continue to care about these female players and the \emph{successors} who come after in years to come? There has long been a belief that football is only for boys. Pu Wei, now retired  \hint{退休} , is one of the best female footballers in Chinese history. When she was a little girl, her father wanted her to become a dancer or a pianist. He could hardly imagine his little girl chasing after a ball. Pu had to fool her father into believing that she was just going jogging when, in fact, she was going to play football. Many female footballers had similar experiences when they were young.

Apart from the absence of support and attention, female footballers face many other challenges. They are, for example, often paid much less than male footballers. In terms of income \hint{收入} , none of the top ten international footballers is female.

When we congratulate the female footballers on their historic win, we shouldn't forget all of the difficulties they have bravely overcome to get where they are today. The next time you talk about Chinese amazing national football, be sure to mention the team that has won the Asian Cup. The girls deserve \hint{值得}  more of our attention and support.

\begin{enumerate}[resume,ref={\arabic*},labelsep=-0.1em]

\item[\choice{C}] According to the passage, to complete the second-half comeback was \blank.
\options
  {impossible}
  {lucky}
  {surprising}
  {uneasy}

\item[\choice{B}] The underlined word “\emph{successors}” in Paragraph 3 probably refers to \blank.
\options
  {coaches}
  {younger players}
  {supporters}
  {football fans}

\item[\choice{D}] We can find that Pu Wei \blank.
\options
  {had a good growth environment}
  {was trained too much by her father}
  {cheated her father and hurt him}
  {kept playing football secret from her dad}

\item[\choice{D}] We can infer that the writer's writing purpose is to \blank.
\options
  {make football more popular}
  {speak for women's rights}
  {collect more football followers}
  {draw attention to women's football}
\end{enumerate}


\ReadingSection{D}

Salted fish is a common food that is popular in the south of China. It is chewy \hint{有嚼劲的} and adds a salty flavor to other dishes. But eating too much salted fish can give you cancer \hint{癌症} ， according to a list of cancer-causing foods that was recently published by the China Food and Drug Administration.

Salted fish is produced with a large amount of salt, which later turns into nitrites \hint{亚硝酸盐} . When nitrites reach our stomach, they turn into another kind of chemical that can cause cancer, Huang Yufang from the Cancer Center of Guangzhou Medical University told Xinhua News Agency.

So does this mean we can't eat salted fish anymore?

“People don't need to worry too much. It has to do with how often you eat certain foods and how much of them you eat,” Huang said. If you really like eating salted fish, you can eat a small amount once or twice a month. Meanwhile, you should also eat more fruit and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C \hint{维他命C} , as this can help to prevent the formation of nitrites. In fact, there are many foods we often eat that are thought to cause cancer, such as pickles \hint{咸菜} , areca palm \hint{槟榔} ，certain fried foods and even red meat, such as pork, lamb and beef.

Although these foods can potentially cause cancer, it doesn't mean a person will get cancer just from eating them, according to the World Health Organization.

Cancer is caused by many different factors such as one's genes \hint{基因} ，environment, lifestyle and eating habits. As long as one has a balanced diet, one doesn't need to avoid cancer causing foods entirely, Fang Yu, a doctor from the Beijing Cancer Hospital, told People's Daily.

\begin{enumerate}[resume,ref={\arabic*},labelsep=-0.1em]

\item[\choice{B}] Why is salted fish popular in the south of China?
\options
  {Because it is a common food in the south of China.}
  {Because it is chewy and adds flavor to other dishes.}
  {Because people in the south of China don’t have vegetables.}
  {Because fish is easy to find and cook.}

\item[\choice{C}] Salted fish may cause cancer when \blank.
\options
  {it is cooked with salt}
  {the salt in it turns into nitrites}
  {people eat too much of it}
  {it is eaten with certain foods}

\item[\choice{C}] What suggestions does Huang Yufang give to salted fish fans?
\options
  {Stop eating salted fish from now on.}
  {Have a small amount of salted fish every day.}
  {Eat more fruit and vegetables to get more vitamin C.}
  {Go to see the doctor if you don't feel well. }

\item[\choice{A}] What can we learn from the last paragraph?
\options
  {Food alone won't make people get cancer easily.}
  {People who have a balanced diet will not get cancer.}
  {One doesn't need to avoid eating cancer- causing food.}
  {People should find a better place to live.}

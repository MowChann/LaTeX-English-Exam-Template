\ReadingSection{C}

They say that “travel is the best teacher” and there is no better example of this idea than the Ming Dynasty travel writer and geographer Xu Xiake(1587-1641). His book The Travel Notes of Xu Xiake, not only encouraged a love of travelling among Chinese people but provided important scientific information about the country's land and geography.

Born into a wealthy Jiangyin family, Xu became interested in books about different places at an early age and wanted to travel. When he was 18, however, Xu's father died and so, it seemed, did his travelling dreams. He now was responsible for the family farm and taking care of his 60-year-old mother as tradition required.

But his mother had different ideas. Understanding her son's love of travel and valuing the knowledge he could get from such experiences, this modern-thinking woman refused to keep her son at home. She agreed that Xu could travel for three months every year, when there was less farm work.

So at the age of twenty and with his mother's support, Xu set off for the first time, leaving behind not only his mother but his new wife as well. He would repeat this goodbye each year for most of the next 30 years. During this time, he travelled throughout the Ming kingdom, carefully studying the lands he passed through and recording his experiences and many discoveries in a diary. This diary, which once had over 500,000 words, would eventually become The Travel Notes of Xu Xiake.

Although rich, Xu avoided comfortable travel, preferring to go almost everywhere on foot. This way he could research the environment in detail and get a true picture of the natural world. Many of his trips were to hard-to-reach mountain areas, and through wild forests where few people lived. His willingness to face hardships came at a cost however. Progress was slow and tiring and he was frequently sick, robbed and beaten during his journeys.

Sadly Xu became seriously ill during his last and longest journey, a 4-year trip through the southwest of China. He died in 1641, soon after returning to his hometown for the last time. When his diary was finally printed years after his death, much of it had been destroyed or lost. Although incomplete, it still made Xu a travelling legend around the world.

\begin{enumerate}[resume,ref={\arabic*},labelsep=-0.1em]

  \item[\choice{A}] What is the passage mainly about?
  \options
    {The general details \hint{细节} of Xu Xiake’s life story.}

  \item[\choice{C}] Why did Xu prefer walking during his travels?
  \options
    {It gave him the chance to meet different kinds of people.}
    {It helped him to save money and travel for a longer time.}
    {It allowed him to see and study the environment in detail.}
    {It was the only way to reach the places he was interested in.}

\ReadingSection{D}

A new contact lens \hint{隐形眼镜片} has been developed by scientists from America，Britain and China. It can check for illnesses at any time by examining chemical in tears. A new sensor \hint{感应器} is used to achieve the purpose.

Scientists hope that the improvement could help to deal with sudden medical events. Dr Zhao Yunlong said:“COVID-19 bas had a great influence on the scientific world. And we are doing research to help people deal with similar events in the future.”

When introducing the new contact lens, Dr. Guo Shiqi, a researcher at Harvard, said. “In the past, the sensor was put between the layers \hint{层} of the lens. It didn't have direct contact \hint{接触} with tears. But our new sensor is smaller and smarter. It can be fixed to a lens and keep direct contact with tears. What's more, it causes no discomfort to the eye.”

The contact lens has not been put to the market, but researchers are quite sure that it will be welcomed. It is especially useful for the old and those who may experience sudden medical events.

As society develops, scientists are supposed to develop more products that provide care and convenience \hint{便利} for people. The contact lens is one of what they are researching on. Earlier，a California company developed another kind of contact lens using LED technology. It can show the health information on the mobile phone. Steve Sinclair, head of the company, said,“We have to build something that helps you when you need it and stays off when you don't need it.”

Have you ever had a dream to make your home a happier place? Maybe there are some points you can follow.

Closing the Gap by American wvriter Jay McGraw gives \completion{suggestions} (suggest) on how to have a better relation \completion{with} your parents.

Then, you can think of a way to make all of you \completion{happy} (happy). He gives you some ideas:

  \item Show your parents you are \completion{growing} (grow) up. Wash your clothes and help clean the house.
